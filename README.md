# Data Visualization

**Author**: Amber Falbo
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
I wanted to tell a story of how drinking more coffee helps with more coding and bug fixing.

I also wanted to tell a story that the larger the body mass of a penguin then the larger the flipper length.

I have these on the same .ipynb

## Getting Started
You will need to Download the dependencies. I downloaded them all because I kept having errors but you should just be able to poetry add seaborn, matplotlib, jupyter and pandas.

## Example
run all the cells

## Architecture
This is using matplotlib, seaborn and jupyter.

## Change Log
I need to keep better track as I was back and forth on my first itteration for awhile here.# data-visualization
